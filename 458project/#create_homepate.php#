   purpose: expects nothing, and returns nothing, BUT does
            expect the $_POST array to contain a key "username"
            with a valid Oracle username, and a key "password"
            with a valid Oracle password;

            ...if it cannot find these, or if it cannot make a
            valid connection to Oracle using these, it
            destroys the session and exits;

            ...otherwise, it tries to create a form with a set
            of radiio-buttons with three choices. The choice made
            will lead to other forms.
